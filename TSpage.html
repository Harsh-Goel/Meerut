        <p class="double">
            An interesting place which not only has religious significance but historical importance as well, Augarnath
            Temple is an important place to see in Meerut. Dedicated to Lord Shiva, this Hindu temple is located in the
            Cantonment area of the city and is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Meerut. It is the place
            where the great revolt of India's independence in 1857 started. The history of this temple in Meerut is
            little known. However, it is said that at this temple, the Maratha rulers used to perform the pilgrimage on
            auspicious occasions making it a significant place of worship in the city. The temple complex also includes
            a memorial which is built to commemorate the martyrs of the Independence War of 1857.<br>
            Along with that, the temple also houses two shrines - Shiva Mandir and Shri Krishna Mandir. Of both the
            temple, the Shri Krishna Mandir is the recent addition in Augarnath Temple. The present structure of the
            temple has replaced the old temple. Until 1944, the temple had a large complex consisting of numerous small
            shrines and a nearby well. Also, it was surrounded by a cluster of trees that make the setting of Augarnath
            Temple a scenic one.<br>
